::
::                      This script has almost everything it needs to be a

::  Revision History
::  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
::
::  Date       By  Version Synopsis
::  ---------- --- ------- --------------------------------------------------
::  2015/06/19 DAG 1.00    Create script essentially from scratch, working
::                         from data captured from the last few interactive
::                         sessions.
::  2015/06/23 DAG 2.00    Correct a minor formatting error, more annoyance
::                         than error, in the flower box.
::  2016/03/29 DAG 3.00    Remove a redundant pause.
::  2016/04/03 DAG 4.00    Suffix the script name with _DEBUG.
::  2016/04/06 DAG 5.00    Differentiate release and debug outputs for the logs,
::                         and change the version string from 5.5 to 6.0.
::  2017/07/12 DAG         Implement my new self-maintaining version marking
::                         method and change the version string from 6.0 to 7.0.
::  2017/08/28 DAG         Adjust the script to derive its paths from its own
::                         location.
::  2021/02/21 DAG Replace ShowTime.CMD with ShowTime.exe, a small 64-bit C++
::                 utility that affords much greater control over the format of
::                 the time display.
