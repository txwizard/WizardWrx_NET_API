            <summary>
            ConsoleAppStateManager is an WizardWrx.DLLServices2.StateManager
            adapter, which exposes the adapted object through its read only
            BaseStateManager property, and extends it with methods that provide
            services applicable exclusively to character mode (console mode)
            programs.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Internally, ConsoleAppStateManager uses some StateManager services that
            could reasonably be expected to be defined locally. In particular, the
            services for ascertaining the redirection state of the three standard
            console handles and the names of the files to which they are redirected
            seem logically out of place.
            
            They are in that library because the ExceptionLogger class, which 
            belongs where it is because it meets needs that are substantially
            identical, regardless of the Windows subsystem in which it runs. While I
            could have made a wrapper that inherits from the ExceptionLogger, that
            seemed pointless for the few lines of code that would have gone into the
            derived class, when this library has unrelated dependencies on
            WizardWrx.Core.

            A fundamental tenet of the Singleton design pattern is that the
            default constructor must be hidden, and it must be the only
            constructor of any kind.
            
            Since the base class has a protected default constructor, derived
            classes must explicitly hide theirs to prevent the compiler allowing
            one to be called.

            scrolled off the screen, all input is eaten (not echoed).
            
            Moreover, you can't jump the gun. Any characters that accumulate in
            the keyboard buffer before the prompt is displayed are swallowed
            whole, with no outward sign that they were eaten. Though I could
            display a message, doing so would, in most cases, be seen as noise
            I might be persuaded to add it to a future version, as an option.

            There are several reasons that you might want to do this. The method
            began as an internal loop in WaitForCarbonUnit. Then, while testing
            the library, I realized that I have another routine that needs to do
            the same thing, which caused me to realize that there might be other
            uses, too.

            <summary>
            Instances of this class permit a line of a console window to be used
            repeatedly for successive lines of text, replacing the contents of the
            previous print statement, so that the lines above it don't scroll off
            the screen.  Once instantiated, instances of this class behave almost
            exactly like Console.WriteLine, and you can drop them into your code
            in its place, because its overloads have identical signatures.
            
            Please see the Remarks.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The magic of this class depends on keeping track of the starting and
            current cursor positions. When a new instance is constructed, the cursor
            position is stored into a pair of private integers, so that it can be
            used whenever one of its Write methods is about to send text to the
            console to determine how far right and/or down the last such operation
            moved the cursor.
            
            Although Console.SetCursorPosition can be used to do so, and is used
            internally, the point of this class is to relieve you of the burden of
            keeping track of the cursor.
            
            Let it manage the cursor, so you don't have to.

            All writers use this method to clear the screen of characters

            but doesn't leave behind part of the last text written if the new
            message needs fewer characters. Please see the Remarks.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Since the writers must always call this method, the current cursor
            location is compared to the position it had at construction time. If
            it hasn't moved, there is nothing to do. This is always the case on
            the first call to a Write method, and it is theoretically possible
            for it to happen again, if the last write operations doesn't move
            the cursor from its starting point, or returns it there.
            
            Although Console.SetCursorPosition can be used to do so, and is used
            internally, the point of this class is to relieve you of the burden of
            keeping track of the cursor. Let it manage the cursor.

            Please see the Remarks.
            </param>
            <remarks>
            The constructors establish the length of internal string variable
            _strFiller, which is filled with exactly enough spaces to fill the
            whole width of the console window. Each time the Reset method is
            called, it evaluates the Console.WindowWidth property, and createes
            a new filler string if its value has changed. This ensures that no
            excess characters that would cause a line wrap are written.
            
            Unlike the other console writers in this class, this method uses the
            regular Console.Error.Write, which doesn't mess with the console colors.
            This enables it to ensure that there is no trailing white space in
            the instance text and background colors.
