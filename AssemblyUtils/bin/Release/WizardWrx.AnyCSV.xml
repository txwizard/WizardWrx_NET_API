            This abstract class encapsulates the core components of my robust string
            parsing algorithm, along with the code and data to support a set of 
            commonly used delimiter and guard characters. 
            
            RobustDelimitedStringParser, a companion class defined in the same
            assembly, is a basic concrete instance of this class, which contains the
            bare essentials needed to expose its functionality to COM. The original
            class, Parser, extends RobustDelimitedStringParser with overloaded class
            constructors and Parse methods.

             To ensure consistent behavior in a loop, once the LockSettings or

             of the instance.
            
             There are two ways for settings to become locked.
            
             1) Call the instance Parse method.

             The fact that there is no inverse (unlock) method is by design, to

            This class defines the most robust CSV string parser that I can
            conceive, based on 17 years of experience writing CSV parsers, leading
            to the discovery today of a use case that breaks parsers that were
            thought to be bulletproof.
            
            Like its parent, RobustDelimitedStringParser, this class relies upon a
            static method on its base class, CSVParseEngine, to do the work.
