    Class Name:			DependentAssemblies

    File Name:			DependentAssemblies.cs

    Synopsis:			Instances of this class gather, sort, and process lists
                        of the dependents of an assembly.

    Remarks:			The Microsoft .NET Framework defers loading an assembly
                        until one of its public classes is referenced. However, 
                        once loaded, an assembly is never unloaded from the
                        AppDomain into which it was loaded. 

                        Hence, to generate a realistic report that reflects the
                        assemblies that would actually load into a process, the
                        dependent assemblies that have yet to see action must be
                        explicitly loaded into an AppDomain.

                        Since an assembly cannot be unloaded for the remaining
                        lifetime of the AppDomain into which it is loaded, the
                        simplest solution is to load each assembly into its own
                        private AppDomain. However, this is not straightforward,
                        because a default assembly load puts copies in both the
                        target AppDomain and the primary AppDomain. Since the
                        Assembly class doesn't derive from MarshalByRefObject,
                        this is accomplished by creating such an object, and
                        letting it own the assembly reference.

                        Finally, the MarshalByRefObject handle is unwrapped in
                        the primary AppDomain, which gets access to the assembly
                        through a factory method on the MarshalByRefObject.

    Algorithm:			Both constructors call a private initialization routine
                        that calls GetReferencedAssemblies on the assembly that
                        was stored into a private Assembly member. The output of
                        this method call is an array of AssemblyName objects
                        that fully describe the dependent assemblies. Next, a
                        generic List of DependentAssemblyInfo objects that has
                        room for the same number of items is constructed and
                        populated by enumeration. Finally, the list is sorted,
                        AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies is called to get a
                        list of the assemblies currently loaded into the primary
                        AppDomain (Every process has a default AppDomain.), and
                        the resulting array is matched against the list of
                        DependentAssemblyInfo objects to identify assemblies not
                        currently loaded.

                        Each assembly that is not already loaded is loaded into
                        a private AppDomain, and a reference to it is returned
                        through a method and stored in the DependentAssemblyInfo
                        list.

                        To report the properties of the dependent assemblies,
                        the DependentAssemblyInfo is enumerated once more, and
                        the properties of each assembly are queried through the
                        reference returned through one of its properties.

    Date       Version  Author Synopsis
    ---------- -------- ------ --------------------------------------------------
    2017/03/30 7.0      DAG    This class makes its first appearance.

    2017/04/04 7.0      DAG    Account for null DomainManager in the default
                               AppDomain, which doesn't exist unless the default
                               application domain is created by the Visual
                               Studio hosting process, or another mechanism that
                               creates a domain manager.

    2018/09/09 7.0      DAG    GetDependentAssemblyByName: Correctly account for
                               the subject assembly being already loaded into
                               the current domain.

    2019/12/14 7.23.120 DAG    Correct internal documentation errors as I
                               prepare to create a freestanding routine that
                               walks the dependency tree of an assembly. The
                               new method is GetDependentAssemblyInfos.

    2019/12/22 7.23.121 DAG    Replace the foreach loops in DisplayProperties,
                               EnumerateDependents, and InitializeInstance with
                               more efficient old-school FOR loops, and feed the
                               loop control variables to the report writers.

    2021/06/21 8.0.187  DAG    Make the list of dependents visible through a
                               read-only property, NamesOfDependentAssemblies.

                               Owing to its simplicity, I dispensed with a test.
