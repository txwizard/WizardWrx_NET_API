            <summary>
            Instances of this class represent individual ASCII characters. Since the
            NUL character is defined, and occupies the first element, the numeric 
            code that corresponds to a character maps directly to the corresponding
            element in this array.
            </summary>
            <example>
            The ASCII code for a space is 32. ASCIICharacterDisplayInfo[32], for C#,
            or ASCIICharacterDisplayInfo(32), for Visual Basic, returns the item for
            the space character.
            
            Likewise, the ASCII code for a horizontal TAB character is 9. Hence, the
            C# expression ASCIICharacterDisplayInfo[9] evaluates to the information
            about the TAB character. Likewise, ASCIICharacterDisplayInfo(9) does the
            same thing in Visual Basic.
            
            The following example comes from production code in the class library
            that motivated me to create this library.
            
                ASCIICharacterDisplayInfo [ ] asciiCharTbl = ASCII_Character_Display_Table.GetTheSingleInstance ( ).AllASCIICharacters;
                StringBuilder sbTheBadChar = new StringBuilder ( );
                sbTheBadChar.Append ( asciiCharTbl [ ( uint ) _chrBad ].DisplayText );
            
            Obviously, more things go into the message before it is returned to the
            calling routine.

            Space, 8, the destructive backspace, 9, the horizontal tab, and
            11, the vertical tab, only one of which, the regular space, is
            considered printable. The nonbreaking space, also printable, is
            classified as an extended character because its code point is
            greater than 127, while the rest fall into the group that is
            comprised otherwise of device control codes. Since that is their
            primary function, they belong in this group.

            you need not actually allocate storage for the instance, since what
            you really need is a copy of the ASCIICharacterDisplayInfo table,
            available through the read only AllASCIICharacters property, which
            can be assigned directly to an AllASCIICharacters array.
            
            To preserve its independence, this class uses the archaic Singleton
            implementation, rather than inherit from the abstract base class in
            WizardWrx.DllServices2.dll, although I could certainly fix that by
            linking the source code into this assembly. Since that creates an
            even more awkward dependency, and I don't want to put an actual copy
            in this source tree, I'll leave it alone. After all, this class is
            not exactly a high traffic property.
