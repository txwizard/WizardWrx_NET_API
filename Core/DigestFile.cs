    Namespace:          WizardWrx.Cryptography

    Class Name:         DigestFile

    File Name:          DigestFile.cs

    Synopsis:           This static class exposes methods for generating message
                        digests of files.

    Remarks:            The initial implementation supports only the MD5 hashing
                        algorithm, to meet an immediate need.

                        This class supports the following algorithms.

                        ------------------------------------------------------

                        ------------------------------------------------------

                        *   MD5 and SHA-1 are classified as broken and unsafe.
                            Both are retained only for backward compatibility.
                            References in code will cause the C# compiler to
                            emit warning CS0618, and other compilers will emit
                            similar warnings.

    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Version Author Description
    ---------- ------- ------ --------------------------------------------------
    2014/02/17 2.2     DAG    Initial implementation.

    2014/06/28 2.3     DAG    1) Add the whole set of SHA algorithms. See the
                                 Remarks section for a complete chart.

                              2) In routine MD5Hash, replace the hand coded I/O
                                 loop, by passing a FileStream into the hasher.

                              3) Mark the MD5Hash and SHA1Hash as obsolete.

    2014/09/21 2.8     DAG    Move DigestToHexDigits from this class into class
                              Utl, rename it ByteArrayToHexDigitString, 
                              reflecting its true calling, and mark it public.

                              Correct a namespace oversight; this class belongs
                              in the Cryptography subsidiary namespace.

                              BREAKING CHANGE ALERT

                              Moving this class to Cryptography is a minor, easy
                              to correct, breaking change.

    2016/06/12 3.0     DAG    Break the dependency on WizardWrx.SharedUtl2.dll,
                              correct misspelled words flagged by the spelling
                              checker add-in, incorporate my three-clause BSD
                              license, and break a dependency upon the local
                              utility class, which is going away.

    2017/08/03 7.0     DAG    Move this class from WizardWrx.SharedUtl4.dll into
                              WizardWrx.Core.dll.

	2025/10/19 9.0.365 DAG    To resolve a file contention that caused the hash
                              routine to prevent another routine from gaining
                              access to a file that it was asked to process, the
                              FileStream object that feeds data to all message
                              digest algorithms is moved out of the method call,
                              and the stream is instead owned by the using block
                              that wraps the message digest object, which was
                              already in a using block of its own, thus ensuring
                              that the stream is properly closed and releases
                              its unmanaged resources including its file handle.
