    Namespace:          WizardWrx.Core

    Class Name:         PropertyDefaults

    File Name:          PropertyDefaults.cs

    Synopsis:           Provide the infrastructure to allow default property
                        values to be stored in a configuration file that belongs
                        to the DLL, and travels with it.

    Remarks:            This class transforms property defaults from hard coded
                        bits in the assembly to something that a user can change
						to suit.

						This class derives from AssemblyLocatorBase. Since
						abstract base classes create an implicit dependency, I
                        moved its definition from WizardWrx.DLLServices, a
						single-purpose class library that exposes this class,
						and contains nothing else. WizardWrx.DLLServices was
						created to test a scenario in which the derived class is
						installed into the Global Assembly Cache. Since any
						library that goes into the GAC must depend entirely on
						assemblies that are signed with a strong name, I needed
						a dedicated class library that I could sign and install
						into the GAC alongside it.

						Though I still have WizardWrx.DLLServices.dll, I moved
						its source code tree to my _Deprecated_Libraries
						directory, and I didn't install it into the GAC on my
						new development machine, code named ENIGMA.

    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Version Author Description
    ---------- ------- ------ --------------------------------------------------
    2014/06/09 1.0     DAG    Initial implementation.

    2014/10/14 5.3     DAG    Take advantage of the relocation of its base class
                              to this library, breaking its link with 
                              WizardWrx.DLLServices and its strong name and the
                              thorny issues that arise when such an assembly is
							  updated, but is installed side by side, rather
							  than in the Global Assembly Cache.

	2015/06/20 5.5     DAG    1) Promote access from internal to public.

                              2) Incorporate my three-clause BSD license.

    2016/06/07 6.3     DAG    Adjust the internal documentation to correct a few
                              inconsistencies uncovered while preparing this
							  library for publication on GetHub.

	2017/02/27 7.0     DAG    Break this library apart, so that smaller subsets
	                          of classes can be distributed and consumed
                              independently.

                              The only effect of this change on this module is
                              it moves into a new namespace, and the new library
                              has a dependency upon WizardWrx.Common.

	2019/04/28 7.15    DAG    EnumerateMissingConfigurationValues is an instance
                              method that reports configuration values that are
                              defined, but are missing from the configuration
                              file.

    2020/12/20 7.24    DAG    Replace the reference to the single instance of
                              UnconfiguredDLLSettings MissingConfigSettings with
                              a call to its static GetTheSingleInstance method.
