# WizardWrx DLLConfigurationManager ReadMe

The purpose of this class library is to provide assemblies with the ability to
read the name of an event source ID string from a configuration file that is
linked to the DLL, and use it to report exceptions in the Windows Event Log, in
addition to the console of a character-mode program or a display window of a
graphical program or Web page, read private profile (.INI) files, and maintain
application state, such as application startup time, uptime, and the state of
its standard handles, if it has them.

If logging of exceptions to console streams is enabled, the exception logger is
smart enough to log the exception to the standard output and standard error
streams if either is redirected, while logging to only one of the two if neither
is redirected.

Distribution includes a sample configuration file, which you should review and
edit to meet your neeeds, as it is likely that at least one item, the event
source ID string, may need to be changed. In addition to the event source ID
string, the configuration file also specifies colors to be used when rendering
fatal and nonfatal errors on the console of a character-mode program.

To maximize compatibility with client code, the library targets version 3.5 of
the Microsoft .NET Framework, enabling it to support projects that target that
version, or any later version, of the framework.

The class belongs to the `WizardWrx` namespace, which I created to organize the
helper libraries that I use in virtually every production assembly, regardless
of what framework version is its target, and whether its surface is a Windows
console, the Windows desktop, or the ASP.NET Web server. To date, I have used
classes and methods in these libraries in all three environments and against
virtually every version of the framework and Base Class Library.

## Using the Library

Since there are no name collisions, you may safely set references to any library
that exposes objects in the the `WizardWrx` namespace in a project, and add a
using directive for any of its subsidiary namespaces to any source module.

This library belongs to the WizardWrx .NET API, which is documented at
[https://txwizard.github.io/WizardWrx_NET_API/](https://txwizard.github.io/WizardWrx_NET_API/).

The easiest way to incorporate the library into your own code is by installing the NuGet package at
[https://www.nuget.org/packages/WizardWrx.DLLConfigurationManager](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WizardWrx.DLLConfigurationManager).

## Revision History

**Note:** Going forward, every release will include a new build of every library in the WizardWrx
.NET API, so that all versions stay reasonably well synchronized. _However_, unless the code changes,
the change log will not cite every library for every release. Moreover, the release notes reported by
the NuGet Package Manager will remain static unless there is a noteworthy change that affects that
library.

The objective of this policy change is to attempt to eliminate dependency diamonds that otherwise
arise inevitably because of unavoidable cascading dependencies among the libraries at the bottom of
the call stack, such as WizardWrx.Common.dll, WizardWrx.ASCIIInfo.dll, and others.

At present, the GitHub repository is not updated between releases. However, changes tend to be developed
and released quickly when the need for a change becomes evident.

This file was originally released a few days after version 7.15 of the WizardWrx .NET API, of which it is a component. To track changes, please see
[https://github.com/txwizard/WizardWrx_NET_API/blob/master/ChangeLog.md](https://github.com/txwizard/WizardWrx_NET_API/blob/master/ChangeLog.md),
which reports changes by namespace and class for each release.
