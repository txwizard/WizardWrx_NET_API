             This Singleton class exposes methods for formatting data from instances
             of the System.Exception class, and commonly used derived classes, and
             displaying the formatted data on a console (strictly speaking, on
             STDOUT, which can be redirected to a file), and recording them in a
             Windows event log.
            
             Unlike most of the classes defined in this library, this class may be
             inherited.
            
             All methods of this class are thread-safe. See Remarks.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             This class was developed to report exceptions in a multi threaded console
             application. Its methods were designed to report messages in a manner
             that is thread-safe, yet keeps each message intact.
            
             Both objectives are achieved fairly easily.
            
             1) All methods use only local variables. The only class level static
             data is a handful of constants, which are, by definition, read only, and
             the private SyncRoot object used to synchronize access to the object and
             its properties. This satisfies the first condition of thread safety,
             because all methods have exclusive access to all of their data.
            
             2) Each message is built up, line by line, by appending to an instance
             of a StringBuilder class, using its AppendFormat method, which behaves
             like the static Format method of the System.String class. Although the
             AppendFormat method is an instance method, since the associated instance
             is local, thread safety remains intact. See Reference 1.
            
             2) A single call to TextWriter.Synchronized ( Console.Out ).WriteLine
             or TextWriter.Synchronized ( Console.Error ).WriteLine writes the
             message, all at once, onto the console, preserving its integrity. Since
             the only event that uses a shared resource is called once only, and that
             call is synchronized, the message display is intact.
            
             Since each method uses the shared resource, access to the console
             Standard Error (STDERR) stream, once only, and does so in a synchronized
             (thread-safe) way, the entire method is thread-safe.
            
             As a reminder to include WizardWrx.DLLServices2.dll in your projects, I
             left this class in the WizardWrx.DLLServices2 namespace. Only symbolic
             constants got promoted to the root namespace.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            DiscardNewlines and NBSpaceForNewlines arose to resolve an issue
            that came to light when a desire arose to reconstruct an exception
            report from the message posted into a Microsoft Excel workbook that
            was populated from the output of a run of PsLogList.exe. To cause it
            to keep each message on a single logical line, so that it would
            import into a single worksheet row,  PsLogList.exe is invoked with
            its -s switch, causing PsLogList to print (output) Event Log records
            one-per-line, with comma delimited fields.
            
            To preserve the newlines in the event log file and have some
            indication of their original positions when PsLogList strips
            them, set the NBSpaceForNewlines flag to TRUE. This causes each
            embedded newline to be preceded in the output by a NOLBREAKING_SPACE
            (ASCII character code 160, A0h, Unicode code point U+0A0) character.
            
            To substitute a NOLBREAKING_SPACE for each newline, set this flag
            AND DiscardNewlines to TRUE.

             The value of the event source associated with the current

             message.
            
             WARNING: Unless your event source string is already registered,
             the application MUST run, one time only, with full administrator
             privileges AND use the event source to write a message into the
             Windows event log in order for it to be registered with Windows,
             which maps it to an event log. Alternatively, you may register
             the event source by any number of other means, such as by way of
             an installation script.
            
             Once the event source string is registered, the application can
             use it to post messages to the event log in any Windows security
             context.

             This roundabout procedure is necessary because the properties cannot
             be set until the object has been created. The most straightforward

             usually performed by a default constructor in this implementation of

             <remarks>
             Typically, a message is truncated because we present the information
             in a more visually appealing and/or accessible format. Of the myriad
             exceptions exposed by the Base Class Library, not to mention custom
             exceptions derived from System.Exception, only a handful are "known"
             types that require attention.
            
             Messages from types that are unknown to this class (i. e., they have
             no entry in the s_dctKnowExceptionTypes dictionary, are preserved.
            
             This private method hides the processing required to cover for the
             unknown exception type.

            </returns>
            <remarks>
            Since making a protected constructor safe for use by a class that
            implements the Singleton design pattern, and a class that calls this
            method causes System.Reflection.Assembly.GetCalllingAssembly to
            report the assembly in which the call executes as the calling
            assembly, any such method must explicitly identify the assembly that
            contains the process entry point.
            
            When the Visual Studio Hosting Process is enabled, it becomes the
            entry assembly, hiding the "real" entry assembly (the assembly under
            test), System.Reflection.Assembly.GetEntryAssembly cannot be used
            safely. Moreover, since the Visual Studio Hosting Process runs in
            the graphical (Windows) subsystem, the entry assembly cannot be used
            to correctly determine whether the entry assembly runs in the
            character mode subsystem.
            
            Although the class needs only the Location property off the Assembly
            instance, I elected to call for the entire Assembly to be passed in,
            to make the needs of this method unambiguous. Since the calling
            method must call one of two static methods on the Assembly class,
            both of which return instances of Assembly, this doesn't impose any
            extra burden on the calling assembly.

             Array of strings, for use as error messages. See Remarks.
             </param>
             <returns>
             Count of error messages loaded into the object. Hence, the Ubound of
             the array is one less than the return value, and its LBound is zero.
             </returns>
             <remarks>
             Error message numbers are array subscripts. This imposes two
             requirements on the list.
            
             1) You must supply a message for the default exit code of zero,
             even if you don't use it.
            
             2) Status codes must be sequentially numbered.
            
             The second requirement can be relaxed, at the cost of inserting one
             or more dummy error messages, which may be empty strings, to account
             for the skipped numbers. The obvious disadvantage is some bloat in
             the message table.
            
             You must call this method before your program can get a useful error
             message from ErrorExit. Although the call to ErrorExit succeeds, the
             message is "Internal error: Unknown status code," followed by the
             supplied raw exit code.
