    Namespace:          WizardWrx

    Class Name:			ClassAndMethodDiagnosticInfo

	File Name:			ClassAndMethodDiagnosticInfo.cs

    Synopsis:			The static methods on this class use compiler-generated
                        metadata to supply details about the currently executing
                        method at runtime without using Reflection.

    Remarks:			These are 100% independent of System.Reflection, relying
                        instead on compile-time metadata supplied by the
                        System.Runtime.CompilerServices class library that ships
                        with version 4.5 and later of the Microsoft .NET
                        Framework.
