            This class extends a FileInfo object with a custom IComparable interface
            implementation.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class and AgedFileInfoCollection are designed to be used together 
            to achieve the goal of processing a list of the files that match a file
            specification from newest to oldest.
            
            These objects are not intended for independent use, since they must go
            into a collection that can be sorted to leverage the IComparable
            interface implementation that permits them to be sorted in reverse order
            by LastWriteTimeUTC.
            
            Each AgedFileInfo is a FileInfo object, wrapped in a small class that
            augments it with a custom IComparable interface implementation that
            allows the list to be sorted by LastWriteTimeUTC. Using LastWriteTimeUTC
            guarantees that the files are always sorted correctly, even when the set
            includes one or more files that were created during the transition hour
            that occurs twice annually, on the days when the transitions to and from
            Daylight Saving Time occur. LastWriteTimeUTC time stamps created during
            this hour are not guaranteed to sort correctly, especially during the
            "fall back" transition that occurs in Autumn, when the local time is set
            back by 1 hour, so that there are two hours during which the same local
            hour is reported.
            
            In the course of investigating an unexpected exception, I again read the
            recommendation from Microsoft (published in the MSDN library) about
            overriding other methods (Equals and GetHashCode), implementing other
            interfaces (IEquatable and IEqualityComparer), and overloading the
            equality and inequality operators, all of which I went ahead and did,
            even though doing so is almost certainly overkill for this class.

            The default constructor would be private, except that I believe that

            While this protects the reference against destruction, it doesn't
            prevent callers from changing read/write properties. For that, each

            Segregating inputs into the correct group is done by evaluating
            the PropertyType.BaseType property of the input PropertyInfo object,
            since enumerations derive from a distinct base type, System.Enum.

             easily accessible. The command line is completely parsed in a single

             Switches, named arguments, and positional arguments may be freely mixed

             organization, coupled with consistent naming and documentation of their

             SECURITY NOTE
            
             All constructors in this class enforce a limit on the number of
             positional arguments permitted. The default limit is 9, which is
             defined as a public constant, POSITIONAL_ARGS_COUNT_LIMIT.
            
             This limit is imposed to protect your program from being fed an
             excessively long command line, in an attempt to cause a denial of
             service. Although few applications require more than nine positional
             command line arguments, the level is made adjustable, to meet that
             once per career need for more than nine arguments.
            
             While objects of this class cannot do anything about the number of
             characters in the command line (That is the responsibility of the
             Common Language Runtime.), they can, and do, limit the amount of
             memory allowed to be consumed to hold arguments parsed from it.
            
             No such limits are imposed on switches and named arguments, because
             the number of valid arguments (hence, the upper limit on memory
             consumed by them) is under programmer control, and unlikely to be an
             issue, since invalid arguments are discarded.
            
             WHY NINE?
            
             I chose the number nine mostly for historical reasons. Starting with
             MS-DOS 1.0, the number of positional parameters supported by batch
             files (without resorting to tricks with SHIFT) is 9.
            
             This limit has been carried forward into modern command processors,
             including CMD.EXE, the default console mode command processor of
             Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, etc.

             SECURITY NOTE
            
             All constructors in this class enforce a limit on the number of
             positional arguments permitted. The default limit is 9, which is
             defined as a public constant, POSITIONAL_ARGS_COUNT_LIMIT.
            
             This limit is imposed to protect your program from being fed an
             excessively long command line, in an attempt to cause a denial of
             service. Although few applications require more than nine positional
             command line arguments, the level is made adjustable, to meet that
             once per career need for more than nine arguments.
            
             While objects of this class cannot do anything about the number of
             characters in the command line (That is the responsibility of the
             Common Language Runtime.), they can, and do, limit the amount of
             memory allowed to be consumed to hold arguments parsed from it.
            
             No such limits are imposed on switches and named arguments, because
             the number of valid arguments (hence, the upper limit on memory
             consumed by them) is under programmer control, and unlikely to be an
             issue, since invalid arguments are discarded.
            
             WHY NINE?
            
             I chose the number nine mostly for historical reasons. Starting with
             MS-DOS 1.0, the number of positional parameters supported by batch
             files (without resorting to tricks with SHIFT) is 9.
            
             This limit has been carried forward into modern command processors,
             including CMD.EXE, the default console mode command processor of
             Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, etc.

             SECURITY NOTE
            
             All constructors in this class enforce a limit on the number of
             positional arguments permitted. The default limit is 9, which is
             defined as a public constant, POSITIONAL_ARGS_COUNT_LIMIT.
            
             This limit is imposed to protect your program from being fed an
             excessively long command line, in an attempt to cause a denial of
             service. Although few applications require more than nine positional
             command line arguments, the level is made adjustable, to meet that
             once per career need for more than nine arguments.
            
             While objects of this class cannot do anything about the number of
             characters in the command line (That is the responsibility of the
             Common Language Runtime.), they can, and do, limit the amount of
             memory allowed to be consumed to hold arguments parsed from it.
            
             No such limits are imposed on switches and named arguments, because
             the number of valid arguments (hence, the upper limit on memory
             consumed by them) is under programmer control, and unlikely to be an
             issue, since invalid arguments are discarded.
            
             WHY NINE?
            
             I chose the number nine mostly for historical reasons. Starting with
             MS-DOS 1.0, the number of positional parameters supported by batch
             files (without resorting to tricks with SHIFT) is 9.
            
             This limit has been carried forward into modern command processors,
             including CMD.EXE, the default console mode command processor of

            Since this class derives from a Dictionary whose keys and values are
            strings, given the string that becomes the pstrArgKey argument of
            this method, you could just as easily get the value directly.
            However, if you did so, you would lose the benefit of default value
            assignment, not to mention the accessors that bundle conversions to
            Integer, Boolean, and Character types. Moreover, reaching into the
            base class makes it slightly less obvious that the value retrieved
            is that of a command line argument, let alone its name and intrinsic
            type (switch versus named argument versus positional argument).
            
            A wiser design would hide the dictionary from view. Notwithstanding
            this one-off use, it is not too late to do so, since this is the
            only case in which I have reached into the base class in this way.

            The value of this property determines how the GetArgDefaultToUse and
            GetSwitchDefaultToUse methods treat an empty string supplied as a
            default value to return. See Remarks for complete details.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The AllowEmptyStringAsDefault property is initialized to FALSE, to
            maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions of the
            library that exports this class.
            
            By default switches return a string value of "OFF" to indicate their
            omission from the command line. To override this behavior, you must
            call the two-argument overload of GetSwitchDefaultToUse, specifying
            a default string value as the second argument.
            
            Prior to version 2.0, this overload treated both null references
            (Nothing in Visual Basic) and empty strings equally, returning the
            class default value of "OFF" in both cases.
            
            Beginning with version 2.0, this behavior can be overridden in one
            of two ways.
            
            1) Setting the AllowEmptyStringAsDefault property to TRUE (signified
            by symbolic constant BLANK_AS_DEFAULT_ALLOWED) changes the behavior
            for the entire class for the rest of its lifetime, or until it is
            set back to its default, whichever comes first.
            
            2) Calling method GetSwitchDefaultToUse or GetArgDefaultToUse with a
            third (Boolean) argument that affects only the behavior of that one
            call, regardless of the current AllowEmptyStringAsDefault setting.
            This method leaves the AllowEmptyStringAsDefault property unchanged.
            </remarks>
            <remarks>
            POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGE:
            
            When the AllowEmptyStringAsDefault property is FALSE and argument
            pstrDefault is a null reference, this method returns the null
            reference. Previous versions returned the empty string anyway, which
            wasn't the intended behavior, and a missing command line argument
            thereby escaped detection.
            
            Hence, going forward, when pstrDefault is NULL, you must be prepared
            to handle a null reference as the return value.

            The settings exposed by this class inhabit a configuration file that is

            Dynamically lookup a function via kernel32!GetProcAddress.
            </summary>
            <param name="functionName">
            raw name of the function in the export table
            </param>
            <returns>
            null if function is not found, else a delegate to the unmanaged
            function
            </returns>
            <remarks>
            GetProcAddress results are valid as long as the DLL is loaded. This
            is very, very dangerous to use since you need to ensure that the DLL
            is not unloaded until after you’re done with any objects implemented
            by the DLL. For example, if you get a delegate that then gets an
            IUnknown implemented by this DLL, you can not dispose this library
            until that IUnknown is collected. Else, you may free the library, and
            then the CLR may call release on that IUnknown, leading to a crash.
            
            Declare your delegate pretty much as you would in C or C++; if you
            happen to have a working typedef, use it as the pattern for your
            delegate declaration, which must have class cope.
            
            Once you have your delegate declared, instantiate it by assigning it
            the value returned by calling this method on an instance that was
            constructed using the name of the DLL that exports the desired Win32
            (or Win64) function.
            
            Since the Win64 API generally uses the same names, signatures, and
            DLL names (e. g., it's still Kernel32.dll, and GetProcAddress is
            still GetProcAddress), most of your existing Windows API calls work
            unchanged in Win64. The magic that makes this possible is that Win32
            code looks in %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64, while Win64 code looks in
            %SystemRoot%\System32 for system libraries. The clear goal of this
            initially confusing scheme was to make porting code to 64 bits as
            painless as possible.

            <remarks>
            This is very dangerous because it suddenly invalidate
            everything retrieved from this DLL. This includes any functions
            handed out via GetProcAddress, and potentially any objects returned

             <returns>
             The message digest, consisting of a string of 32 hexadecimal
             characters. This string is identical with the strings returned by
             the reference implementation, published by Dr. Ronald Rivest, who is
             credited with inventing the MD5 digest algorithm.
             </returns>
            <remarks>
             Since the internal hashing implementations expect byte arrays, the
             input string must be converted. The Encoding.Default.GetBytes method
             is called upon to convert the string into a byte array.
             
             A slightly modified version of the Rivest code, written in ANSI C,
             is the engine in my MD5WIN stand-alone program and my MD5Digest
             Windows Dynamic Link Library.
             
             However, this function uses a MD5CryptoServiceProvider object, which
             provides a managed interface to the Cryptographic Service Provider
             in the host's installation of Microsoft Windows. I chose this over
             the 100% managed implementation for two reasons.
             
             1) The CSP implementation uses native machine code for the
             computation, and should outperform managed code on large plain-texts.
             
             2) By using the native implementation, the CLR is eliminated as a
             potential point of failure due to a weakness in the implementation
             of the algorithm.

            <remarks>
            Because of its intended use, this class is designed without a public
            default constructor. I believe that it is extremely unlikely that a
            user would need to serialize an instance of this class.

            <remarks>
            The optimizations in this implementation take advantage of a guarantee
            made by the framework that it won't bother to call a static constructor
            on a class until its first use. Moreover, a static constructor is never
            called more than once, no matter how many subsequent references to the
            class occur.
            
            Taking advantage of these features of the framework eliminates the need
            for synchronization, and replaces a method call with a direct reference
            to the static read only property that returns a reference to the one and
            only instance.

            The private constructor has no real work to do, but it must exist to

            would violate a critical constraint of the Singleton design pattern.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This property is marked protected to give derived classes direct
            access to it, which their static members require. For example, in

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            I had to stop and think for a minute about why the first token in
            the r-value is the upper case T, enclosed in parentheses. Then, I
            realized that it is an explicit cast.
            
            More obvious, due to recent experience adding a static constructor
            to another class, is that the static constructor cannot have an
            access modifier, and is, by definition, private. This simplification
            of the Singleton design pattern takes advantage of the fact that the
            framework won't run the static constructor until the first reference
            to the class arises.

            is treated as a master list, into which new and updated items from
            from the second list are merged.
            
            Merging is based on comparing items from both lists based on the
            values returned by their respective CompareTo methods. Values that
            return zero (equality) are merged by replacing the value from the
            first list, represented by the first argument (paMasterList) with
            that from the second list, represented by the second argument
            (paNewItems).
            
            This algorithm imposes four requirements on its inputs.
            
            1) Both input arrays must be composed of objects of the same type.
            
            2) That type must implement the IComparable interface.
            
            3) That type must have a default constructor.
            
            4) Both input arrays must be sorted.
            
            In return, it makes the following four guarantees.
            
            1) Every item in array paNewItems will become part of the new list.
            
            2) Every item in array paMasterList that has no matching value in
            array paNewItems will become part of the new list.
            
            3) Every item in array paNewItems that matches an item in array
            paMasterList replaces that matching item.
            
            4) Every item in array paNewItems that doesn't match any item in
            paMasterList is added to the list.
            
            On input, both lists must be sorted, which is the first reason that
            the objects in the arrays must implement IComparable. The second
            reason is that this routine must compare the two lists in order to
            merge them correctly. The comparison happens in CompareTwoOfAKind, a
            companion routine that also takes generics meeting the first of the
            two specified constraints.

            I shamelessly borrowed this idiom from Perl, with full credit to
            Larry Wall, and implemented it as a macro for the C and C++ source
            code preprocessors about a decade ago. I don't know why it's taken
            me this long to realize that it is equally easy to implement in C#,
            and the implementation is sufficiently small that the code optimizer
            will almost certainly inline it, so that its performance impact is
            equivalent to the C/C++ macro.
            
            The C# implementation is not quite as neat as the C/C++ macro.

            The first three format items, {0}, {1}, and {2} are reserved for the
            label, value, and item number. Additional format items, if any, are
            populated from the objects in the SupplementaryDetails array.
            
            The FormatDetail method creates a new object array with enough room
            to hold the SupplementaryDetails array, plus three, fills it by
            inserting the label, value, and item number into the first three
            slots, and appending the SupplementaryDetails array, if it exists,
            and passes the whole array to string.Format.
            
            Unless its value differs from the current static (default) value,
            this property stays NULL. When callers query this property, the
            static property is returned if the instance property is null. Hence,
            the property behaves like a instance property, without wasting space
            to store duplicates of the default value. Hence, output routines
            need not check both properties.

            To make the class a tad more robust, if the rhe property is null,
            the DisplayValue is returned, unless it is also null. This gets
            around an ambiguity that causes the constructor to put a String into

            as labels or members of an enumerated type. This method has at least
            three use cases.
            
            1) Pad the strings to a uniform length, so that all of a set of
            labeled values aligns vertically.
            
            2) Construct a key from several substrings, such that the substrings
            are of uniform length, and the keys can be grouped by any of the
            leading substrings, and ordered by the values of the last substring.
            
            3) Construct a composite format string that reserves enough room for
            the widest item in the list, so that whatever follows it on a report
            line aligns vertically.

            Since they are escaped when entered into a .NET resource (.RESX)
            file, such TAB characters must be handled a tad differently, using
            the doubly escaped token that represents a TAB character embedded in
            a resource string as the first argument to the Replace method on the
            input string, pstrTokenTemplate. To cover the case where the string
            is a constant, embedded in the source file, this case must call the
            Replace method on the new string returned by the first Replace call,
            passing a string representation of the regular TAB character, since
            the replacement is the empty string.
            
            In all other cases, the Replace method is called once, using the
            actual delimiter character, pchrFieldSeparator.

            This is a class of extension methods for performing common tasks not
            provided by the System.String class. All but the four Pad methods are
            derived from long established routines in companion class StringTricks.
            
            Just as importing the System.Linq namespace makes its generic extension
            methods visible, importing the root WizardWrx namespace, accompanied by
            a reference to WizardWrx.Core, makes these methods visible on every
            instance of System.string.
            
            Rather than create ane entirely new class to support one small method, I
            extended this class to cover RenderEvenWhenNull, even though it is a
            generic method.

            Because this method is generic, it can call the ToString override on

            you derive the benefits of any such override.
            
            The optional <paramref name="pstrFormatString"/> and
