    Namespace:          WizardWrx

    Class Name:         SpecialCharacters

    File Name:          SpecialCharacters.cs

    Synopsis:           Define a handful of frequently used characters that can
                        be difficult to correctly differentiate in a source code
                        listing, either in print or in a text editor window.

	Remarks:            This class is one of a constellation of static classes
						that define a wide variety of symbolic constants that I
						use to make my code easier to understand when I need a
						refresher or am about to change it.

						This class implements a subset of the characters defined
                        in WizardWrx.MagicNumbers. Some of those constants,
                        especially those intended mainly for use with arrays and
                        lists, have moved into sibling classes in this library.

    Revision History
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Date       Version Author Description
    ---------- ------- ------ --------------------------------------------------
    2014/09/14 1.0     DAG    Initial implementation.

	2015/06/06 5.4     DAG    Break completely free from WizardWrx.SharedUtl2.

	2015/06/20 5.5     DAG    Relocate to WizardWrx class library, 
                              promote to the root WizardWrx namespace, add
                              special characters that I originally defined in
                              class WizardWrx.SharedUt2.MagicNumbers, and
                              cross reference related constants defined in other
                              classes.

    2015/08/31 5.6     DAG    Add a couple of overlooked special characters.

    2016/04/06 6.0     DAG    Add a full-stop character that I discovered was
                              overlooked in the last review.

    2016/06/07 6.3     DAG    Adjust the internal documentation to correct a few
                              inconsistencies uncovered while preparing this
							  library for publication on GetHub.

	2017/02/28 7.0     DAG    Break this library apart, so that smaller subsets
	                          of classes can be distributed and consumed
                              independently.

						      This module moved into WizardWrx.Common.dll, while
                              remaining a part of the root WizardWrx namespace.
 
	2017/06/29 7.0     DAG    Define the ASTERISK and QUESTION_MARK constants.

	2017/07/15 7.0     DAG    Define the DLM_FORMAT_ITEM_BEGIN, BRACE_LEFT, and
                              BRACE_RIGHT symbolic constants. BRACE_LEFT is the
                              antecedent of DLM_FORMAT_ITEM_BEGIN, and
                              BRACE_RIGHT matches its left handed twin.

	2017/08/26 7.0     DAG    Complete the constellation of parenthetical pairs,
                              adding BRACKET_* and PARENTHESIS_*, along with
                              ENV_STR_DLM, which motivated this edit, and the
                              long overdue HASH_TAG.

	2017/09/03 7.0     DAG    Correct XML documentation errors found during the
                              last otherwise successful build, and define a few
                              more special characters: NOLBREAKING_SPACE,
                              CHECK_MARK_CHAR, LAST_ASCII_CHAR.

	2018/10/07 7.1     DAG    Cross reference the new SpecialStrings.SPACE_CHAR,
	                          and put the out-of-order constants into alphabetic
							  order by name.

	2019/04/27 7.15    DAG    Cross reference the following single-character
                              strings that I just added to the SpecialStrings
                              class.

                                   COLON
                                   COMMA
                                   DOUBLE_QUOTE
                                   FULL_STOP
                                   HYPHEN
                                   SEMICOLON
                                   SINGLE_QUOTE
                                   TAB_CHAR
                                   UNDERSCORE_CHAR

	2020/12/23 7.24    DAG    Add the following special characters that I need
                              to exist as constants so that their values can be
                              ussed in switch statements.

									ALARM       = ASCII character code 7
									BEL         = Synonymn for ALARM
									BELL        = Synonymn for ALARM
                                    BACKSPACE   = Also called Non-Destructive BS
									END_OF_FILE = The MS-DOS End of File
									EOF			= Synonymn for END_OF_FILE
									ESCAPE_CHAR = The MS-DOS Escape character

						      At the moment, there are no analogoue string
                              representations of these characters, nor do I see
                              a need for them.

	2021/10/13 8.0.170 DAG    This release incorporates two new character
                              constants, SpecialCharacters.PLUS and
                              SpecialCharacters.MINUS.
	
	2022/09/17 9.0.239 DAG    LOGICAL_NEGATE supersedes my long-time favoorite,
                              PIPE_CHAR, as my preferred text delimiter.
