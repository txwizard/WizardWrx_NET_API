<h1 id="introduction-to-the-wizardwrx-net-api">Introduction to the WizardWrx .NET API</h1>

<p>I created the <strong>WizardWrx .NET API</strong> to simplify the C# and VB.NET programming
that I do for myself and my clients. Predecessors of the code published herein
are in production in my office and those of my clients throughout the United
States, and some found its way into the articles that I publish from time to
time on The Code Project, such as
<a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/989985/Console-Magic-Part-Messages-in-Living-Color" title="Console Magic, Part 1: Messages in Living Color">Console Magic, Part 1: Messages in Living Color</a>.</p>
<p>The libraries were compiled against versions 2.0 and 3.5 of the Microsoft .NET
Framework, and they are compatible with versions from 3.5 up. The classes in
these libraries define numerous constants, most assigned to the base <code>WizardWrx</code>
namespace, and utility classes, organized into subsidiary namespaces.</p>
<p>Since there are no name collisions, you may safely set references to all 6
namespaces in the same source module.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>API Documentation</strong> link in the navigation bar at the top of this page
to display a summary of the classes, along with links to complete documentation
of the public constants, enumerations, and methods exposed by them.</p>
<h1 id="road-map">Road Map</h1>
<p>For the most part, this constellation of class libraries evolves to acommodate
needs as they arise in my development work. Nevertheless, I have a road map, and
it has a few well-marked stops.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>NuGet Packages</strong> are a certainty, once I decide whether there should be
one package or seven (1 for each library, plus a rollup that contains all six),
and find time to create them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The classes that process <code>FormatItems</code> and <code>FormatStrings</code> could stand
to be made easier to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>DigestString</code> and <code>DigestFile</code> support only MD5 and the SHAx message
digest algorithms. While that covers the two most commonly used algorithms, I
would like to cover others, and add HMAC digest authentication support. I have a
native library, implemented in ANSI C, that supports HMAC, but I have yet to
investigate what it would require to convert it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>AgedFileInfo</code> and its companion <code>AgedFileInfoCollection</code> could stand some
companions that support other orderings of file lists, such as by size, type, or
name.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ExceptionLogger</code> should define an interface to simplify replacing its
<code>ReportException</code> methods. Formatting of <code>ReportException</code> output could also
stand to be a bit more flexible. I have made several attempts to do so, all of
which I eventually abandoned because they were too cumbersome.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ReportDetail</code> and <code>ReportHelpers</code> were intended to be the foundation of
an ambitious report generator for character-mode programs of the sort that are
the lifeblood of systems software. These two classes came into being to meet the
immediate requirements of a system utility that I created for processing the
files that store the form and report directories of a DataEase data base. Since
then, they have languished, and I have yet to put together a road map for the
report writer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Devise a simple, automated mechanism to have the configuration file
associated with a DLL that defines a class that derives from <code>PropertyDefaults</code>
follow it, as do the associated XML documentation and program data base (<code>.pdb</code>)
files.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>
<p>Though I created this library to meet my individual development needs, I have
put a good bit of thought and care into its design. Moreover, since I will not
live forever, and I hope these libraries can outlive me, I would be honored to
add contributions from others to it, and eventually designate a new owner. My
expectations are relatively few, simple, easy to meet, and intended to preserve
the consistency of the code base and its API.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Naming Conventions</strong>: I use Hungarian notation. Some claim that it has
outlived its usefulness. I think it remains useful because it encodes data
about the objects to which the names are applied that follows them wherever they
go, and convey it without help from IntelliSense.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Coding Style</strong>: I have my editor set to leave spaces around every token.
This spacing has helped me quicly spot misplaced puncuation, such as the right
bracket that closes an array initializer that is in the wrong place, and it
makes mathematical expressions easier to read and mentally parse.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Comments</strong>: I comment liberally and very deliberately. Of particular
importance are the comments that I append to the bracket that closes a block. It
does either or both of two things: link it to the opening statement, and
document which of two paths an <strong>if</strong> statement is expected to follow most of
the time. When blocks get nested two, three, or four deep, they earn their keep.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Negative Conditions</strong>: I do my best to avoid them, because they almost
always cause confusion. Astute observers will notice that they occur from time
to time, because there are <em>a few cases</em> where they are <em>less</em> confusing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Array Initializers</strong>: Arrays that have more than a very few initializers,
or that are initialized to long strings, are laid out as lists, with line
comments, if necessary, that describe the intent of each item.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Format Item Lists</strong>: Lists of items that are paired with format items in
calls to <code>string.Format</code>, <code>Console.WriteLine</code>, and their relatives, are laid out
as arrays, even if there are too few to warrant one, and the comments show the
corresponding format item in context. This helps ensure that the items are
listed in the correct order, and that all format items are covered. This
practice has exposed countless bugs very early, when they are easy to correct.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symbolic Constants</strong>: I use symbolic constants to document what a literal
value means in the context in which it is used, and to disambiguate tokens that
are easy to confuse, suzh as <code>1</code> and <code>l</code> (lower case L), <code>0</code> and <code>o</code> (lower case O),
literal spaces (1 and 2 spaces are common), underscores, the number <code>-1</code>, and so
forth. Literals that are widely applicable are defined in a set of classes that
comprise the majority of the root <code>WizardWrx</code> namespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Argument Lists</strong>: I treat argument lists as arrays, and often comment each
argument with the name of the paramter that it represents. These lists help
guarantee that a long list of positional arguments is specified in the correct
order, especially when several are of the same type (e. g., two or more integer
arguments). This practice exposes bugs early, some subtle, when they are easy to
correct.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triple-slash Comments</strong>: These go on <em>everything</em>, even private members and
methods, so that everything supports IntelliSense, and it's easy to apply a tool
(I use DocFX.) to generate reference documentation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With respect to the above items, you can expect me to be a nazi, though I shall
endeavor to give contributors a fair hearing for a good case. Otherwise, please
exercise your imagination, and submit your pull requests. When I get NuGet
packages implemented, I'll take care of rolling the contributions into the
appropriate packages, and contributors will get prominent credit on the package
page in the official public repository. If you skim the headnotes of the code,
you will notice that I take great pains to give others credit when I icorporate
their code into my projects, even to the point of disclaiming copyright or
leaving their copyright notice intact. Along the same lines, the comments are
liberally sprinkled with references to articles and Stack Overflow discussions
that contributed to the work.</p>
